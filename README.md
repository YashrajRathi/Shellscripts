# Shellscripts

## Reason 
These are few shells scripts that I have learnt for my automation part 

## Use
You can add the [shortcut](https://github.com/YashrajRathi/Shellscripts/tree/main/shortcuts) scripts to your machine
Then add them as aliases in ~/.bashrc as below
`````````````````````````````````````````````
alias jj='~/shellscripts/shortcuts/jj.sh'
alias hm='cd ~/shellscripts/shortcuts'
`````````````````````````````````````````````
