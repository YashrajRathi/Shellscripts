# Shellscripts

## Reason 
These are few shells scripts that I have learnt for my automation part 

## Use
You can add the [shortcut](https://github.com/YashrajRathi/Shellscripts/tree/main/shortcuts) scripts to your machine
Then add them as aliases in ~/.bashrc as below
`````````````````````````````````````````````
alias jj='~/shellscripts/shortcuts/jj.sh'
alias hm='cd ~/shellscripts/shortcuts'
alias gg='~/shellscripts/shortcuts/gg.sh'
alias ch='source ~/shellscripts/shortcuts/ch.sh'
alias aa='source  ~/shellscripts/shortcuts/ch.sh -a'
alias sudo='sudo ' ## In order to gedit with root access
alias sk='~/shellscripts/shortcuts/sk.sh'
alias chd='source ~/shellscripts/shortcuts/ch.sh -d'

`````````````````````````````````````````````
